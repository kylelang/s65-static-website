To kick things off in style, we have a special treat: a video lecture from the
author of lavaan, himself, Yves Rosseel. In the following video, Yves gives you
the developer's perspective on the motivation for, and history of, the lavaan
project. In addition to an interesting discussion of lavaan's development history,
you will also get to "peak behind the curtain" as Yves discusses some of the more 
negative aspects of developing open-source software. Enjoy this candid look into
the mind of lavaan's creator, and feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments
section below.
