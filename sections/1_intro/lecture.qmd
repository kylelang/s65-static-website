Welcome to the first lecture of this course. This lecture gives you an introduction to SEM in lavaan and, more specifically, to running a regression model using lavaan.

The (updated) slides of this lecture can be found at the bottom (under the header Resources). Please note the change on the slide "4. Specify your model: regression answer 2". 

Below, you can find the lecture recordings covering the slides. Feel free to play the video on double speed.

## Recordings

Unfortunately, the recordings do not capture my mouse cursor (it was visible in the recording program, but apparently I needed to tick a box or so). In case anything is unclear, please ask me or Kyle during the Q&A session or via a discussion platform.
