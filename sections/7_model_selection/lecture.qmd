Welcome to the last lecture of this course. This lecture gives you an introduction to model selection for lavaan SEM models,
where we will mainly look at the AIC and the so-called GORICA and at IC weights.

You can dowload the slides of this lecture below. I also added a new set of slides that contain the newest R code (of
the R package restriktor).

## Recordings

I thought I figured out how to capture my mouse cursor, but in the first recording it is not visible anymore after some
slides.
