While the BCa CI does, indeed, correct for bias and skewness in the empirical sampling distribution, the CI calculated by lavaan::parameterEstimates() when specifying boot.ci.type = “bca.simple” does not include the acceleration correction. So, the intervals we get from lavaan are only corrected for bias in the empirical sampling distribution. For more (technical) information about the different flavors of bootstrapped CI, see DiCiccio & Efron (1996).\n\n\n\nSerial Multiple Mediator Models\n\n\n\nModel Modification & Pruning\n\n\n\nBigger Models\n\n\n\nMediation with Latent Variables"

In the following video, Yves gives you the developer’s perspective on the motivation for, and history of, the lavaan project. In addition to an interesting discussion of lavaan’s development history, you will also get to “peak behind the curtain” as Yves discusses some of the more negative aspects of developing open-source software. Enjoy this candid look into the mind of lavaan’s creator, and feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments section below.\n\nLecture Slides"
